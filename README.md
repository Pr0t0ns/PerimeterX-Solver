🗞️ DESCRIPTION 🗞️

As promised I posted my PerimeterX Solver for PX version v6.7.9. I completely reversed this myself and didn't care to "improve" or "beautify" the code so please don't expect the program to be the most efficent. 

🤑 Extra 🤑

For the more advanced people yes the code isn't great and if you wanted their is still much to improve. their are few hardcoded values in the WEBGL fingerprint that are dynamic, I just didn't want to waste time reversing those keys since I was already generating valid cookies for the majority. Feel free to make a pull request if you add any of these features.
