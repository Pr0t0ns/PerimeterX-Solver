🗞️ DESCRIPTION 🗞️

As promised I posted my PerimeterX Solver for PX version 6.7.9. I completely reversed this myself and I didn't care to "improve" or "beautify" the code so please don't expect the code to be the most efficent. 

🤑 Extra 🤑

For the more advanced people yes the code isn't great and if you wanted their is still much to improve. their are few hardcoded values in the fingerprint that are dynamic I just didn't want to waste time reversing those keys since I was already generating valid cookies. Feel free to make a pull request if you add any of these features.
